This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving the interplay of CSS `display: none` and `visibility: visible`.  The bug highlights an important distinction between these two CSS properties. While `display: none` completely removes an element from the document flow, `visibility: visible` simply makes an element visible if previously hidden.  Applying both properties in the order shown in the `bug.html` file leads to the element occupying space in the layout but not being visually rendered. The solution demonstrates a correction.
